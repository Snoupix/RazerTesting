# RazerTesting

This is my first C# Console Application project. I wanted to use the [Razer](https://www.razer.com/) API or SDK to communicate with my Razer devices, especially my keyboard.

As I always do when I want to learn a new language, I try to make the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and since I can communicate with my keyboard, I used it as a grid display.

This Console app has 2 features:
- ASCII art display on Console and/or keyboard
- Game of Life on Console and/or keyboard

## NuGet package
- [Colore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Colore)
